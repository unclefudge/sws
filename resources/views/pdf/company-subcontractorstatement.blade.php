                        A principal contractor can be generally defined to include any person who has entered into a contract for the carrying out of work by another person (or other legal entity

                    person (or other legal entity) referred to as the subcontractor, and employees/workers of that subcontractor will perform the work under contract. The work must be connected to
                    the business undertaking of the principal contractor.
                </li>
                <li>Provide the unique contract number, title, or other information that identifies the contract.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>In order to meet the requirements of s127 <i>Industrial Relations Act 1996</i>, a statement in relation to remuneration must state the period to which the
                        statement relates. For sequential Statements ensure that the dates provide continuous coverage.</p>
                    <p>Section 127(6) of the <i>Industrial Relations Act 1996 defines remuneration ‘as remuneration or other amounts payable to relevant employees by legislation, or under an

                            instrument, in connection with work done by the employees.’</i></p>
                    <p>Section 127(11) <i>of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 states ‘to avoid doubt, this section extends to a principal contractor who is the owner or occupier of a building for
                            the
                            carrying out of work in connection with the building so long as the building is owned or occupied by the principal contractor in connection with a business undertaking
                            of the
                            principal contractor.’</i></p>

                <li>Provide the date of the most recent payment claim.</li>
                <li>For Workers Compensation purposes an exempt employer is an employer who pays less than $7500 annually, who does not employ an apprentice or trainee and is
                    not a member of a group.
                </li>
                <li>In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that workers compensation insurance premiums payable up to and including the date(s)
                    on the Statement have been paid, and all premiums owing during the term of the contract will be paid.
                </li>
                <li>In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all remuneration payable to relevant employees for work under the contract has
                    been paid.

                <li>In completing the Subcontractor’s Statement, a subcontractor declares that all payroll tax payable relating to the work undertaken has been paid.</li>
                <li>It is important to note that a business could be both a subcontractor and a principal contractor, if a business ‘in turn’ engages subcontractors to carry
                    out the work. If your business engages a subcontractor you are to also obtain Subcontractor’s Statements from your subcontractors.

            <h5 class="text-center"><b>Statement Retention</b></h5>
            <p>The principal contractor receiving a Subcontractor’s Statement must keep a copy of the Statement for the periods stated in the respective legislation. This is currently up to seven
                years.</p>
